Knights are powerful but simple minded: use the arrow keys or W,S,A,D to move around, the space-bar to jump and T or Enter to chat. That’s all.

First you have to build your own tower. The built-in level creator allows you to do so very easily. Just choose a starting position. After that place lethal traps along a path that leads to the finish. When you are done building you have to complete your own tower at least once, this proves that your tower is actually 'beatable'. When you start a multiplayer session, all players have to select one of their own towers(you can also select a default tower). When everyone is ready, the bloody race begins!

Tower Master is created by Triangle Studios.
